# day-to-day: spec and test activity tracker

What's this then? Somewhat simplfied:
* A list of interesting specs is derived from [specref](https://github.com/tobie/specref).
* For each spec, a [test suite](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) is identified.
* Activity in those specs and test suites is monitored and [visualized](https://foolip.github.io/day-to-day/).

See [testing in standards](https://github.com/foolip/testing-in-standards) for why this might matter.
